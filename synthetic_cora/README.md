### Data preparation

The data can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TbC-10pF2WlfbYLmu_gPV8TcXEBYeyOl/view?usp=sharing

Simply unpack it and create a new directory called `data` inside this project directory and put all .npz files in there.
The predefined splits get downloaded automatically through pytorch geometric.
