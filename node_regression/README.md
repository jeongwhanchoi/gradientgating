### Data preparation

The data can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andreagarritano/wikipedia-article-networks/download?datasetVersionNumber=1
(or alternatively if you don't want to log-in to kaggle: https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/MUSAE/tree/master/input)

Simply unpack it and put the raw .json and .csv files (chameleon and squirrel) 
inside a data directory inside this project. 

In order to access the standard splits, run the heterophilic_graphs experiment for chameleon and squirrel. 
This will automatically download and store the required standard splits.
